# Lookup Abstraction

Stwo provides powerful abstractions for implementing efficient lookup tables in AIRs.

## Overview

Lookup tables in Stwo allow for:

- Efficient verification of value membership
- Reduced polynomial degree
- Composition of multiple tables
- (planned)GKR integration

## Performance Considerations

- Table size vs. proof size tradeoffs
- Optimal table composition strategies
- Memory usage optimization
- Lookup batch processing
