# How Does Circle-STARK Work?

This section dives into the technical details of Circle-STARKs, the proof system that powers Stwo. Here you'll find:

- An explanation of AIRs and how they work in Stwo
- Details about Circle STARKs and their advantages
- Information about lookups and how they're implemented

Circle-STARKs are a key innovation in Stwo, providing efficient proofs over the Mersenne-31 prime field. This section will help you understand the underlying technology that makes Stwo fast and efficient.
