# AIR Development

> This section is intended for developers who want to create custom proofs using Stwo (proofs of custom VMs, ML inference, etc.). It assumes that the reader is familiar with Rust and have some background knowledge of cryptography (e.g. finite fields). It does not assume any prior knowledge of zero-knowledge proof systems, but it does assume that the reader is familiar with the concept of zero-knowledge proofs and knows what they want to create a zero-knowledge proof for.

In this section, we will introduce concepts around AIRs and show how to use Stwo abstractions to create custom AIRs optimized for specific use-cases. We will go through multiple examples to help you get started, so stay tuned!
