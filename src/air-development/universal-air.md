# Stwo As a Universal AIR Prover/Verifier

Stwo is designed as a universal framework for proving and verifying Algebraic Intermediate Representations (AIRs). This chapter explains how Stwo serves as a foundation for various zero-knowledge proof applications.

## Universal AIR Framework

Stwo provides a flexible framework that allows developers to:

- Define custom AIRs for specific computational tasks
- Leverage optimized proving mechanisms
- Utilize efficient lookup tables
- Compose multiple AIRs together

## Core Components

The universal AIR framework consists of:

1. **AIR Definition Layer**

   - Custom constraint systems
   - Trace generation
   - Polynomial commitments

2. **Proving Layer**

   - Circle STARK proving system
   - Efficient Mersenne31 field operations
   - Lookup table optimizations

3. **Verification Layer**
