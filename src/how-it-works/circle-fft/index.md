# Circle FFT

> This section introduces the Circle FFT algorithm, used to interpolate bivariate polynomials over the circle domain using a divide-and-conquer approach. It explains the sequence of domains, the projection and squaring maps and provides a step-by-step explanation of the interpolate function.
