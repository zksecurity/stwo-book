# How to Write an AIR using Stwo Abstractions

This guide walks through the process of creating a custom AIR using Stwo's abstractions and tools.

## AIR Structure

An AIR in Stwo consists of:

1. Trace columns
2. Transition constraints
3. Boundary constraints
4. Lookup tables (optional)

## Best Practices

When writing an AIR:

1. Keep constraints simple and modular
2. Use lookup tables for repeated patterns
3. Optimize field operations
4. Consider composition with other AIRs
